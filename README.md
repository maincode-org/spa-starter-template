# spa-starter-template
Get moving fast, with this React Single Demo Application quickstarter template.

To get started, simple `cd` into the `ionic-app` folder, and run:

```shell
> npm install

> npm run prepare

> ionic serve
```

## Folder structure
We have three main folders in src:
- components
- screens
- styles

In components we have React functional components. <br/>
In screens we have screens or what atomic design would call [pages](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). Screens will almost always consist mostly of components. <br/>
In styles we have a global stylesheet, ionic theming and potentially other stylesheets.
